# BAM API

A GraphQL, "production ready"™ api for internal use at bam, but open sourced as an example !

## Foreword

Finding great ressources on the client side graphql is pretty easy, for instance, for apollo, there is https://www.learnapollo.com/.

Finding great ressources on the server side is way more difficult. GraphQL is only a spec and there is litterally at least 20 differents languages implementations.

That being said using the project as a boilerplate to start simple project with GraphQL may be less preagmatic than using great SASS, like https://www.graph.cool/ !

## Goals

The goals of this repo are:
- to have a graphql api that can be used as a reference for existing and new graphql project,
- to have a graphql api that show some "production ready"™ tricks, that are not easy to find on the web (for instance oauth authentication and access control),
- to investigate the devlopment tooling around graphql apis (flow, eslint ect),
- to investigate good way to put containers on production (docker, maybe kubernetes ^^),
- to have a centralized api to start cool project at bam, like internal tools and so !

Non goals of this repo are:
- to be minimalist
- to be a boilerplate generator for the forseable future (that being said, we might extract our `create-graphql-api` app from this later on)
