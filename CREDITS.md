## https://github.com/entria/graphql-dataloader-boilerplate 

by @sibelius and rest of entria

This boilerplate was really good and inspired alot of this project, in peculiar for the viewerCanSee pattern.
However we use postgres instead of mongo and does not target relay but apollo.

We are using apollo server, to write less code, given the "*.gql syntaxic language" types.

Thus the structure and the goal of the app is slightly different.
